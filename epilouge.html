Chatpter 11: 

Years later the government charges the farm  by charging rent and this makes the farm very hard to afford. So in order of this Martin goes back to victoria to get some money from a job he started called Plextronics. In plextronics Martin hires people to invent new farm items such as the wool plucker, the snipper wipper and the crab flab. These iventions were intended on to sell really well but sadly the ideas were stolen from him. Martin acknowledged his defeat and went back to the farm. He decided to walk the boundaries again. 

 

Martin started to walk as memorys past by ( Dracula, Meg, Wullamendulla, the big snake and old ted)
